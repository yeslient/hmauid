 * each has a family of mechanisms that can answer it, each mechanism registers
 * itself with the order it wants (tiers.c reads the registry), and this file is
 * what starts the walk, names the winner in the log, and takes everything back
 * at unload. The mechanisms live in the files named after them:
 *
 *   inline_hooks.c   short entry hooks for find_user / cap_task_fix_setuid
 *   table_hooks.c    the uid queries / the id setters in sys_call_table
 *   lsm.c            the LSM hook the kernel hands both creds to
