 * The package database as a stream of events, whichever form it was written in.
 *
 * The platform writes /data/system/packages.xml in two ways: Android's binary
 * XML (ABX) since Android 12, and plain XML before that, or on a device whose
 * writer never moved. Xml.resolveSerializer() picks between them from the
 * system property persist.sys.binary_xml, and Xml.resolvePullParser() reads a
 * file by sniffing its first four bytes, so both forms live side by side on
 * real devices. This header is the one thing a consumer uses: it hands out the
 * same events either way, so the code that reads packages out of the document
 * cannot drift apart between the two.
 *
 * The readers are separate translation units - abx.cpp for the binary form,
 * text_xml.cpp for the text one - and neither is part of this interface.
