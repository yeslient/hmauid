 *
 * The format is a token stream, not the older resource chunk layout: a byte per
 * event with the payload type in the high nibble and the event in the low one,
 * then the payload. Strings are interned the way FastDataInput/FastDataOutput
 * do it - the first occurrence is written out ("0xffff" marks it, followed by a
 * length in modified UTF-8), every later one is a plain unsigned short index
 * into the table built so far.
 *
 * Only what this program needs is decoded: tags, their names, and attributes
 * with string or integer values. Anything else (bytes, floats, comments,
 * namespaces, a token that is not known at all) ends the stream with Bad: the
 * caller keeps whatever it had instead of acting on a half-read document.
