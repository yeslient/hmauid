 * kaux.h - the wire format of the netlink family the helper talks to.
 *
 * The module (src/netlink.c) and the tool (src/tools/netlink.cpp) both include
 * this file, so the two ends of the protocol cannot drift apart: what was a
 * comment on each side before is one definition here.
 *
 * Family version 3 has not been published, so this layout is the published one
 * and there is no earlier revision to stay compatible with.
 *
 * Everything is little endian and a multiple of four bytes long, so the
 * structures below are the wire image as they stand, with no packing:
 *
 *   KAUX_CMD_PING           -> ACK                    nothing, alive and version
 *   KAUX_CMD_STAGE_BEGIN    blob = struct kaux_begin  kind, byte count, crc32
 *   KAUX_CMD_STAGE_CHUNK    blob = u32 offset, u32 len, then len bytes
 *   KAUX_CMD_STAGE_COMMIT   -> ACK                    applies the staged blob
 *   KAUX_CMD_STATUS         -> reply: KAUX_ATTR_STATUS = struct kaux_status
