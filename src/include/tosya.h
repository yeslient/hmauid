 * The first uid a hidden target may be replaced with. Two properties matter, and the

 * chain they would for the target itself, and it has to be a value the kernel rejects
 * as cheaply as any ordinary uid that does not exist. The window is low for the second
 * one: on a device, getpriority(PRIO_USER, x) costs about 10 ns more to answer for
 * x = 0x40000000 than for x = 10500, and that difference is exactly the timing signal
 * between "hidden" and "no such uid" that uidbench measures. 20001..24096 (the window
 * is POLICY_REPL_MAX wide) is not inside any uid range Android hands out -- apps are
 * 10000..19999 per user, isolated children 90000..98999 -- so make_replace() can take
 * its candidate arithmetically for the hash the kernel uses (make_replace() in policy.c)
 * and never has to ask the kernel whether one is free.
