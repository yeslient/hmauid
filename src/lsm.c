 *
 * Registration is the shape KernelSU uses. The hook heads are resolved by name,

 * function pointer replaced by this module's, which runs first and calls what it
 * replaced. Nothing is added to or taken out of a list an LSM registered, so the
 * shape of every hook list is left exactly as it was, and unloading puts the
 * pointer back.
 *
 * Only the setuid hook is taken. The gid setters ran the same code, but a gid
 * change does not move the fsuid, so that path only ever saw a value that had not
 * changed and had nothing to record.
