"""Lift the inode shadow block out of src/policy.c for the host test.

The block is compiled for the kernel only (it needs inodes), so the host test
needs it as a source of its own. It is extracted rather than copied on purpose: a
copy would go stale without anything noticing, and this refuses to produce
anything when the markers or the pieces they are supposed to contain are gone.
